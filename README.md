      INTRODUCTION TO NE0BOT 
───✱*.｡:｡✱*.:｡✧*.｡✰*.:｡✧*.｡:｡*.｡✱ ───

The NE0BOT is used to help moderate and liven up your discord server. This bot can help with auto-moderation, and can also do things such as roll dice and play 8ball, rock paper scissors, and play card games. It also can recommend media and content to your server members, make advertisements for member and server content, and converse with other members in full length conversations. Not only that, but this bot can also give server statistics, send videos, gifs, and other media, and help with math. NE0BOT provides discord servers with advanced, yet easy to use commands and quick, easy moderation and spam control, making it so that this bot can help with moderation, even when all admins are offline.
